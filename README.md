## Advantage to Linked-List: It is dynamic so you can add data without having to shift elements over. Instead, you just have to change at most a couple pointers.

## Disadvantage to Linked-List: Searching them is not constant time since you have to traverse each node.

## Advantage to Array: Finding a particular user is easy since the search time is constant. Just search by index.

## Disadvantage to Array: When storing the user profile, we don't know how many users we may have which poses the biggest drawback of having to upgrade to a new array if we need more space which means a lot of copying will have to take place which is expensive.
